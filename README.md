Festival Project: As part of my digital marketing course, I’m working on a project that involves developing a comprehensive marketing strategy for a chosen festival. This project includes:

- **Audience Research and Persona Development**: Conducting research to understand the target audience, and developing detailed personas to guide the marketing strategy.
- **SEO and Keyword Analysis**: Conducting research to identify high-impact keywords and optimise the festival’s online presence.
- **Landing Page Development**: Creating a responsive, user-friendly landing page using HTML, CSS, and Visual Studio Code, designed to capture leads and drive engagement.
- **Social Media Calendar**: Planning and scheduling posts across multiple platforms to align with key marketing events and boost festival visibility.
- **Marketing Position Map**: Analysing the market landscape and defining the festival’s unique position to target the right audience effectively.

Through this project, I’m applying my growing skills in SEO, web development, and digital content strategy to create a cohesive and results-driven marketing campaign.
